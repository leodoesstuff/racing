# Monza Arcade Multiplayer

Web-first, Node-powered, top-down F1-inspired racer with lobbies, AI drivers, DRS, ERS, and slipstream modeling for Monza.

## Quick start

```bash
node server/index.js
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to create or join a lobby, add AI, and drive.

## Notes

- The server is authoritative and streams state via SSE to the client.
- Inputs are posted on a short interval; DRS is only effective in the two configured zones.
- ERS drains when active and recharges slowly when idle. Slipstream gives a mild boost if you are tucked behind another car.

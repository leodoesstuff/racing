# Monza Arcade Multiplayer

Web-first, Node-powered, top-down F1-inspired racer with lobbies, AI drivers, DRS, ERS, and slipstream modeling for Monza.

## Quick start

```bash
node server/index.js
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to create or join a lobby, add AI, and drive.

## Notes

- The server is authoritative and streams state via SSE to the client.
- Inputs are posted on a short interval; DRS is only effective in the two configured zones.
- ERS drains when active and recharges slowly when idle. Slipstream gives a mild boost if you are tucked behind another car.

## Deploying on Render

There are no external dependencies, so deployment is lightweight:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render, create a **Web Service** from the repo.
3. Set **Environment** to **Node** (Node 20+ recommended).
4. Build command: `npm install`  
   Start command: `node server/index.js`
5. Health check path: `/api/health`
6. Auto-assign the **PORT** env var (Render does this automatically); the server binds to it.
7. Optional: set **Root Directory** to `/` (project root).

Static assets are served from `client/public` by the same Node service, so a single web service is sufficient. For persistence (lobbies reset on deploy), add a datastore later and wire it into `server/index.js`.
